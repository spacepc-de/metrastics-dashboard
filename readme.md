# Metrastics: Meshtastic Network Analyzer & Commander

Metrastics is a Django-based web application designed to listen to a Meshtastic network, store device and packet information, and provide a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing this data. It also includes a "Commander" feature for rule-based automated responses to messages and integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## Features

* **Live Data Listening:** Connects to a Meshtastic device (via TCP/IP) to listen for live packet data, node updates, and connection status.
* **Data Persistence:** Stores all received information (nodes, packets, messages, positions, telemetry) in a database.
* **Dashboard Overview:**
    * Displays listener and local node status.
    * Shows average signal statistics (SNR/RSSI) over the last 12 hours.
    * Provides counters for total packets, nodes, and various packet types (messages, positions, telemetry, user info, traceroutes).
    * Includes an overview map of all nodes with known locations.
    * Lists recently active nodes with key information.
    * Features a live packet feed displaying recent network activity.
* **Nodes Page:**
    * Lists all discovered nodes with detailed information.
    * Search functionality for nodes (by name, ID, hardware model).
    * Pagination for easy navigation.
    * Modal view for detailed node information, including:
        * General details (ID, name, hardware, firmware, role).
        * Status (last heard, battery, signal, uptime).
        * Position data and a map of the node's last known location.
        * Detailed telemetry (device and environment metrics).
        * Raw JSON data (user info, module config, channel info).
* **Map Page:** Displays all nodes with valid location data on a Leaflet map.
* **Commander Module:**
    * Define rules to automatically respond to incoming Meshtastic messages.
    * Rules can be based on exact match, contains, startswith, or regex for the trigger phrase.
    * Use placeholders in response templates to include dynamic data from the sender, local node, or message.
    * Set cooldown periods for rules per node.
    * **ChatGPT Integration:** Interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT directly via Meshtastic. Send a message starting with a configurable trigger command (e.g., `!chat`) followed by your query.
* **Admin Interface:** Full Django admin interface for managing raw data models (Nodes, Packets, Messages, etc.) and Commander Rules.

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Django, Python
* **Meshtastic Interaction:** `meshtastic` Python library
* **Database:** SQLite (default), configurable via `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., PostgreSQL)
* **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, jQuery
* **Mapping:** Leaflet.js
* **Real-time Updates:** AJAX polling
* **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`
* **AI Integration:** `openai` Python library

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main Django apps:

* `metrastics_listener`: Contains models for all Meshtastic data (Node, Packet, Message, Position, Telemetry, etc.) and the management command (`listen_device`) responsible for connecting to the Meshtastic device, processing incoming data, and saving it to the database. It also handles the Flask-based API endpoint for sending messages and is configured to start automatically with the Django development server.
* `metrastics_dashboard`: Provides the views, templates, and API endpoints for the web-based user interface where users can view the collected data, node details, maps, and live feeds.
* `metrastics_commander`: Manages the rules for automated responses and the ChatGPT integration. It includes models for `CommanderRule` and views for managing these rules via the UI and an API.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/spacepc-de/metrastics-dashboard.git](https://github.com/spacepc-de/metrastics-dashboard.git)
    cd metrastics-dashboard 
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (same level as `manage.py`).
    Copy the contents from `.env.example` (if provided) or create it with the following content, adjusting values as needed:

    ```env
    # Django Settings
    SECRET_KEY=your_strong_secret_key_here  # Replace with a strong, unique key
    DEBUG=True  # Set to False for production
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1 # Comma-separated list of allowed hosts

    # Database Settings (Default is SQLite)
    # DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
    # Example for PostgreSQL:
    # DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname

    # Timezone and Language
    LANGUAGE_CODE=en-us
    TIME_ZONE=UTC # e.g., Europe/Berlin

    # Meshtastic Device Connection
    MESHTASTIC_DEVICE_HOST=localhost # Hostname or IP of the device running meshtastic-device (TCP interface)
    MESHTASTIC_DEVICE_PORT=4403      # Port for the Meshtastic TCP interface

    # Logging Levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
    DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    LISTENER_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    COMMANDER_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    MESHTASTIC_LIB_LOG_LEVEL=INFO # Set to WARNING or ERROR to reduce Meshtastic library verbosity
    PUBSUB_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
    OPENAI_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    ROOT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

    # OpenAI / ChatGPT Integration
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here" # Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
    CHATGPT_TRIGGER_COMMAND="!chat"
    CHATGPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are a helpful assistant on a Meshtastic network. Keep your answers concise due to message length limitations. Max 200byte Answer"

    ```
   
    **Important:** The `listen_device.py` script uses a hardcoded port `5555` for its internal Flask app that facilitates sending messages. Ensure this port is free or modify the script if needed.

5.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
    This will create the necessary database tables based on the models in `metrastics_listener`, `metrastics_commander`, and other Django apps.

6.  **Create a Superuser (for Admin Access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create an administrator account.

7.  **Start the Django Development Server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The Meshtastic listener (`listen_device` command) is configured to start automatically in a separate thread when the Django development server starts. You should see log messages indicating its startup in the console.
    By default, the web application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Run with Docker Compose

An easier way to start the project is via Docker Compose. This builds a container with all dependencies and runs the Django development server.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values as needed.
2. Build and start the service:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

   The dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage

* **Dashboard:** Access the main dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/` (or the root `/` if configured as such).
* **Nodes List:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/nodes/`.
* **Nodes Map:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/map/`.
* **Commander Rules:** Access the Commander interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/commander/`.
    * View existing rules.
    * Edit basic properties of rules (name, trigger, response, cooldown, enabled status).
    * For adding new rules or more complex modifications, use the Django Admin interface.
* **Admin Interface:** Access at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with your superuser credentials. Here you can manage all data and Commander rules directly.

## Configuration Details

Key configurations are managed via the `.env` file:

* `SECRET_KEY`: A long, random string used for cryptographic signing. **Keep this secret in production.**
* `DEBUG`: Set to `False` in a production environment.
* `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: A list of hostnames/IPs that are allowed to access the application.
* `DATABASE_URL`: Specifies the database connection. Defaults to a local SQLite file (`db.sqlite3`).
* `TIME_ZONE`: Sets the timezone for the application.
* `MESHTASTIC_DEVICE_HOST` & `MESHTASTIC_DEVICE_PORT`: Define how to connect to your Meshtastic node's TCP interface.
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key from OpenAI for ChatGPT integration.
* `CHATGPT_TRIGGER_COMMAND`: The command prefix to trigger ChatGPT interaction over Meshtastic.
* `CHATGPT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: The system prompt used to instruct ChatGPT on its behavior.
* Various `*_LOG_LEVEL` variables: Control the verbosity of logging for different parts of the application.
